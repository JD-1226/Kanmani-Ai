# Kanmani AI

Kanmani AI is a personal voice-based assistant built with Python.
This project was more than just coding — it was a complete learning journey where I explored how AI assistants work under the hood, how Python connects with system tools, and how different platforms affect development.

## About the Project

When I started this project, I wanted to build something that could listen, understand, and respond — like a mini AI companion.
Throughout the process, I experimented with **LangChain**, **PyAudio**, **SpeechRecognition**, and **Selenium** to make the assistant more interactive and intelligent.

The idea was simple:

> “Create something that talks back — and learn everything behind making that happen.”

## What I Learned

Working on **Kanmani AI** taught me a lot about how Python and AI tools actually work:

* 🐍 I discovered that **not all Python versions support AI libraries.**
  Even though Python 3.13 is the latest, many AI packages still only work with **3.10 or 3.11**. This made me realize how version compatibility can make or break a setup.

* ⚙️ I learned that many popular libraries like **LangChain**, **PyAudio**, and **Selenium** actually depend on **C++ developer tools** underneath.
  It was fascinating to see that Python acts as a bridge — but the real power often comes from C++ speed and compilation behind the scenes.

* 💻 I worked on both **Mac** and **Windows**, and that gave me hands-on experience with how installation commands, dependencies, and even environment setups differ between systems.
  The same package sometimes needed completely different steps on each OS!

* 🧩 I became more confident troubleshooting dependency errors, understanding virtual environments, and managing version control for AI-related packages.

Overall, this project helped me appreciate how much work goes into getting AI tools to run smoothly — not just the code, but the system-level setup too.

## About Me

I’m **JeevaNantham**, a Python developer exploring AI, web, and automation technologies.
Kanmani AI was one of those projects that taught me how deep the connection between code, compiler, and system really is — and how every small configuration matters when working with AI.
